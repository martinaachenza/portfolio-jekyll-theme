# Martina's Portfolio

Hi everyone, my name is Martina and I am 29yo. I live in Edinburgh and I am about to finish a course at Imperial College in Data Analytics. I currently work in another industry but looking forward to starting my career in data. I am currently developing a project as a final assignment for the course. The project aims to analyse the incidence of injuries in sports and which other factors are contributing to getting injured again and their recovery time. In my spare time, I love playing volleyball and having long walks with my dog, a very energetic Sprocker spaniel, who has an obsession with playing fetch.
