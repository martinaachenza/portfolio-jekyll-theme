# Martina's Portfolio

Hi everyone, my name is Martina and I am 29yo. I live in Edinburgh and I am about to finish a course at Imperial College in Data Analytics. I currently work in another industry but looking forward to starting my career in data. In my spare time, I love playing volleyball and having long walks with my dog, a very energetic Sprocker spaniel, who has an obsession with playing fetch.
